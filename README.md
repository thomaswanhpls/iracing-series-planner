## Dashboard

The `/dashboard` route displays a simple planner for racing series using components styled with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). It lists each series with a 12 week schedule and lets you mark which tracks you own and which series you are interested in.

To start developing, install dependencies and then run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If the `shadcn` components are missing, run the setup script:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```
